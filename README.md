# Ninja One's Frontend Task

React client web application to work with devices.

## Features

- Dashboard with listed devices
- User can filter devices by one type
- User can sort devices by system name and hdd capacity
- User can add, update or delete devices

## Requirements

- Make sure to have up and running the server app

```bash
cd devicesTask_serverApp
npm install && npm start
```

Usually the .env is not included in the project, but just for this time I've added it so the project just works.
